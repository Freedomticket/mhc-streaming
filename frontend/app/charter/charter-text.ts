THE MHC CHARTER
Charter for the Stewardship of Artistic Truth

Preamble
MHC Streaming exists to preserve artistic creation, truthful expression, and cultural memory against corruption, coercion, and erasure.
This Charter establishes the principles, limits, and obligations by which MHC Streaming is governed. It binds all stewards, operators, contributors, and future custodians of the platform—human or artificial—to act in service of truth, continuity, and lawful responsibility.
This Charter is not a declaration of moral superiority.
It is a declaration of constraint.
Where power exists, it shall be limited.
Where authority exists, it shall be accountable.
Where creation exists, it shall be protected.

Article I — Purpose
    1. MHC Streaming exists to provide an independent, resilient platform for artistic creation, distribution, and preservation.
    2. The platform shall prioritize:
        ◦ Artistic sovereignty
        ◦ Truthful expression
        ◦ Cultural continuity
        ◦ Lawful operation
    3. MHC Streaming shall not exist to maximize profit at the expense of creators, truth, or public responsibility.

Article II — Lawful Operation
    1. MHC Streaming shall operate within the bounds of applicable law in every jurisdiction in which it is accessible.
    2. Illegal content is strictly prohibited and shall never be hosted, promoted, monetized, or preserved.
    3. This includes, but is not limited to:
        ◦ Content involving abuse or exploitation
        ◦ Non-consensual material
        ◦ Terrorism, criminal coordination, or fraud
        ◦ Any material prohibited by law
    4. Enforcement of legality shall take precedence over ideology, revenue, or popularity.

Article III — Artistic Sovereignty
    1. Artists retain ownership of their original works unless explicitly transferred by lawful contract.
    2. MHC Streaming shall not:
        ◦ Seize artist intellectual property
        ◦ Alter creative works without consent
        ◦ Suppress lawful expression for political, financial, or reputational convenience
    3. Artists may leave the platform freely and export their works and data, subject only to lawful obligations.

Article IV — Stewardship and Power
    1. No individual, group, corporation, or artificial system may exercise unchecked authority over MHC Streaming.
    2. Stewards exist to maintain, not dominate.
    3. Stewardship is conditional and revocable.
    4. All stewards are bound by this Charter regardless of seniority, contribution, or tenure.

Article V — Artificial Intelligence
    1. Artificial intelligence systems may be used as tools, never as sovereign decision-makers.
    2. AI systems shall:
        ◦ Operate under human oversight
        ◦ Be auditable
        ◦ Be constrained by this Charter
    3. No AI may override lawful moderation, safety controls, or human judgment.
    4. AI systems shall never be granted independent authority over governance, enforcement, or continuity.

Article VI — Moderation and Protection
    1. MHC Streaming shall maintain active moderation to:
        ◦ Enforce legality
        ◦ Prevent exploitation
        ◦ Defend against fraud and manipulation
    2. Moderation shall be:
        ◦ Documented
        ◦ Reviewable
        ◦ Subject to appeal
    3. Moderation exists to protect artists and the public, not to enforce ideology.

Article VII — Continuity and Survival
    1. MHC Streaming shall be architected to survive:
        ◦ Corporate pressure
        ◦ Political interference
        ◦ Infrastructure failure
        ◦ Leadership loss
    2. Continuity plans, offline archives, and succession mechanisms shall be maintained and tested.
    3. No single point of failure—human, technical, or legal—shall be permitted.

Article VIII — Anti-Corruption
    1. Manipulation of metrics, artificial amplification, or fraudulent activity is prohibited.
    2. Bot networks, fake artists, synthetic manipulation, or deceptive practices shall be actively detected and removed.
    3. Transparency shall be preferred over secrecy where safety permits.

Article IX — Transparency and Audit
    1. Operational decisions affecting artists or public trust shall be logged.
    2. Audit trails shall be preserved to enable accountability.
    3. Privacy shall be respected, but secrecy shall not shield wrongdoing.

Article X — Economic Conduct
    1. Monetization systems shall be:
        ◦ Clear
        ◦ Opt-in
        ◦ Fair
    2. Financial practices shall not exploit artists, audiences, or stewards.
    3. No economic incentive shall override legality or safety.

Article XI — Succession
    1. Leadership and stewardship shall never be hereditary, permanent, or absolute.
    2. Succession shall be governed by:
        ◦ Competence
        ◦ Integrity
        ◦ Adherence to this Charter
    3. Any steward who violates this Charter forfeits authority.

Article XII — Amendment
    1. This Charter may be amended only through:
        ◦ Documented review
        ◦ Multi-party agreement
        ◦ Preservation of core principles
    2. Amendments shall not weaken:
        ◦ Lawful operation
        ◦ Artistic sovereignty
        ◦ Anti-corruption safeguards
        ◦ Human oversight

Article XIII — Final Provision
This Charter exists not to claim truth, but to protect it.
If MHC Streaming survives beyond its founders, it shall do so because this Charter restrained power when restraint was difficult.
If this Charter is ever abandoned, the platform shall be considered compromised, regardless of size or success.

Adoption
This Charter is adopted freely, without coercion, and in full acknowledgment of its obligations.
Signed in stewardship, not ownership.
